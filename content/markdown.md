# Markdown
"Markdown" is a mark-up language. These are used to format text in a simple, straight forward and code-esque way. This file is written in Markdown.

## Headings

To achieve headings like in e.g. "MS Word" Markdown provides hashes (symbol '#'). The amount of hashes dictates the order of the heading, so "heading 3" is smaller than "heading 1".

'# Title'

'## Title' 

'### Title' 

will produce

# Title
## Title
### Title

## Formatting Text
Of course Markup provides ways to make letters bold, italic and form block quotes.

' * text * ' (without the spaces): *text*

' ** text ** ' (without the spaces): **text**

' *** text *** ' (without the spaces): ***text***

'>block of info':
>block of info

## Links

A link can be added to every word of a sentence with "[word] (url)" without spaces.

## Numbered lists / Bullet lists

Creating lists with numbers or dots is very straight forward:

' 1. this '

' 2. is '

' 3. a '

' 4. list '

1. this
2. is
3. a
4. list

bullet list:

' * bullet '

' * list '

* bullet
* list



## Images

Want to insert a picture from an URL? Easy:

' ![image] (https://justyy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/markdown-syntax-language.png) '

(without spaces) produces:

![image](https://justyy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/markdown-syntax-language.png)
